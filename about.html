        <h1 class="test">About Us</h1>
        <p class="descripcion">Our journey began on January 1st with a simple but powerful idea: learning can be smarter, more efficient, and more accessible when powered by artificial intelligence. 

            This project was born from real student experiences—long study sessions, overwhelming amounts of information, limited time, and study methods that often fail to adapt to individual needs. Seeing this challenge firsthand inspired us to build a platform that redefines how students learn and prepare. 
            Founded by Ryzer, our startup was created with a clear mission: to place artificial intelligence at the center of modern education. Not as a shortcut, but as an intelligent study companion designed to support understanding, practice, and long-term retention. 
            Our platform leverages advanced AI to generate a wide range of study materials, including flashcards, quizzes, summaries, practice questions, and personalized learning resources. By adapting to each student’s level and goals, we help turn complex content into clear, structured, and engaging study tools. <br>
            
            From day one, our vision has been guided by four core principles: <br> </p>
            <ul class="descripcion">
                <li>Personalization – Every student learns differently, and our tools adapt accordingly.</li>
                <li>Efficiency – Study smarter, not longer.</li>
                <li>Accessibility – Powerful learning tools should be available to everyone.</li>
                <li>Continuous Innovation – We evolve alongside technology and the real needs of students.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="descripcion">We do not aim to replace teachers or traditional education. Instead, our goal is to enhance the learning process, giving students intelligent tools that help them stay organized, practice effectively, and gain confidence in their knowledge. 
            At its core, this startup is about empowerment—helping students take control of their education and unlock their full potential through intelligent, adaptive learning.</p>
